# TeamIt Extra SwiftUI

Same exercise for Team It on the Non Storyboard but using SwiftUI.

Just wanted to go one step ahead and make the same project using SwiftUI. I thought it to be interesting since the original request does not use Storyboards.

Although SwiftUI is not yet 100% used/adopted because of integration with UIKit projects, I did (fell in love with SwiftUI)* so had some time and this is it...

I have to admit as well that are still a lot of areas I'm not 100% comfortable whennusing SwiftUI but the resources out there are growing and growing.



# Some Details

- Works on both light and dark mode but I did not focus very much in UI details as I'm sure we can implenent the any design we want (given we have the design details)
- Some of the helper classes I used on the Non-Storyboard exercise, are not 100% of my liking but I can work on it later. Like caching images and others...

# Comments

Comparing both projects, in terms of lines of code, it's not that different (except for the build Labels and Buttons)!
